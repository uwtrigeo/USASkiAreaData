The data on this map was created by obtaining digital terrain models (DTM) for each ski area. The DTM for each resort was then analyzed in ArcGIS Pro where the slope and aspect was established. Those two layers were then combined and the North and East facing slopes with a pitch between 30 and 40 degrees were then isolated and applied to this map.<br></p>

The z-score, which typically occurs between -2 and +2, was then converted to a score between 1 and 20, 1 being for a z-score value below -1.8 and 20 for a value above +1.6. The sum of the converted z-score values in each element for each resort was used to provide a Total Score for a ski result with the higher scoring resorts representing a higher value above the mean in an element.</p>
